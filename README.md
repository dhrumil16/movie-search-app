 # 🎬 Movie Search App

The Movie Search App is a feature-rich, responsive web application built with **React.js** that allows users to search for movies using the **OMDb API**, view details, and add movies to their favorites list. It is designed to provide a clean and intuitive user experience without relying on any external UI libraries. The styling is implemented using only custom CSS, with a focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and modern UI aesthetics.

This project aims to demonstrate how to effectively use APIs in a React application, how to manage components and state, and how to build user-friendly layouts with reusable and modular code. It's also a great example of building a scalable frontend structure that could be extended into a larger media-based application in the future.

The home screen features a centered movie search bar where users can enter keywords to find movies. Once a search is submitted, matching movies are fetched from the OMDb API and displayed in a responsive grid layout. Each movie card includes a poster, title, release year, and a button to add it to the favorites list. This makes it easy for users to browse through the movies quickly and select their favorites.

The favorites feature is another core part of the app. Users can view all their selected favorites on a dedicated page. Each movie in the favorites section is displayed using the same responsive and attractive card format. This helps maintain a consistent look and feel across the application. The ability to add and view favorites improves user interaction and engagement, and sets a foundation for features like local storage or backend saving in future updates.

The entire UI is styled using custom CSS with a vibrant linear gradient background, glowing buttons, and card shadows for modern depth and visual appeal. Every part of the app — including the search input, button hover effects, and grid responsiveness — is optimized to look good across different screen sizes, making the app fully mobile-friendly.

The application was developed with React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects efficiently. The project also uses **React Router** to manage navigation between the home page and the favorites page. This helps in maintaining clean and scalable code for larger projects.
